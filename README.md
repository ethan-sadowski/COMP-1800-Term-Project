# COMP 1800 - Reminder App Documentation

## Project Purpose:
The mission of this project is to develop and ship/host a working reminder app. 
The finished produce will allow users to create a reminder, delete a reminder, and edit a reminder.
In addition, the reminders will allow the use of tags, subtasks, and dates associated with the reminder. 
Users will also be able in import or export their reminders as files, and also demonstrate a form of user authentication. 
Finally, the product will incorporate two API's, the DarkSky Weather API and the HTML5 Geolocation API, and will inform users if they will need an umbrella on the day of their reminder.
